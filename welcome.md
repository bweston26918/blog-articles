# Welcome to my new blog!

Over the coming days & weeks, I'll be putting my thoughts down on a range of articles relating to my primary passions: cloud, containers, Linux, DevOps, infrastructure and their related tool sets.  I hope you'll find them an interesting read.   

This article, along with all the others that come after it, has a level of automation; articles are written locally, pushed to GitHub using the same workflow that I use for any other project, and automation on the blogging platform does the rest.  Magic!   

If you're interested, you can find the source [here](https://github.com/bweston26918/blog-articles).   

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, the easiest way is through my socials such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bweston26918).
